# Forecasting Main Repository

## Overview

The Forecasting repository is dedicated to advancing the accuracy and applicability of trend forecasts, particularly focusing on demographics and socially valuable variables across the Richmond Region. Initially employing SARIMAX and Facebook Prophet models in the `Forecasting_1` branch, this project is an ongoing effort to explore and integrate more complex forecasting techniques. Our goal is to refine our predictions, offering even more accurate and reliable insights into housing market trends by ZIP code.

### Objectives

- **Enhance Forecasting Accuracy**: Continuously improve upon the foundational SARIMAX model by exploring advanced forecasting methods and integrating them into our analysis.
- **Expand Regional Coverage**: While currently focused on the Richmond Region, future developments aim to apply these forecasting techniques to additional areas, broadening the project's scope and impact.
- **Strengthen Model Optimization**: Leverage automation and machine learning to fine-tune model parameters, ensuring optimal forecasting performance across diverse datasets.
- **Foster Community Contributions**: Encourage the community to contribute new ideas, models, and approaches to enhance the project's forecasting capabilities and applicability.

### Key Features

- **Automated Model Optimization**: Initial models (SARIMAX and Facebook Prophet) automatically select the best parameters for accurate forecasting, with plans to extend this automation to new models.
- **Comprehensive Regional Analysis**: Provides detailed ZHVI forecasts for each ZIP code in the Richmond Region, with ambitions to expand to new regions.
- **Visual Accuracy Assessment**: Utilizes Test_RMSE maps and other visualization tools to evaluate and illustrate forecast accuracy.
- **Identification of Growth Potentials**: Analyzes data to highlight areas with significant growth potential, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.

### Motivation
